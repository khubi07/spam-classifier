📩 SMS Spam Classifier using Machine Learning
A machine learning–based SMS Spam Classifier that predicts whether a given message is Spam or Ham (Not Spam) using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and supervised learning models.
This project demonstrates the complete ML pipeline — from data preprocessing and feature extraction to model training, evaluation, and comparison.
